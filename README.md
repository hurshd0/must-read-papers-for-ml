- :point_right: :arrows_clockwise: Submit Pull Request If I am missing any important papers, or links don't work.
- :point_right: Reading paper with heavy math is hard, it takes certain dedication and motivation to thoroughly get them, don't be discouraged, read once, read twice, read thrice,... until it clicks and blows you away.
